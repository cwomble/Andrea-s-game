This is a 2D platformer game I am making for my wife.

I have plans for how the game will go but I am still working on finishing the engine.
Eventually I hope to add an in-game map editor as well as 50+ levels.

Will be adding information to this readme as I progress.


Everyone is free to use any part of this game in their own projects, but a link
back here would be nice.

Special thanks to ForeignGuyMike for his insightful videos on youtube!
